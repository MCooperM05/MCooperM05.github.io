        <p>
          The team's affinity diagram shows a cluster of the general solutions or fixes to solve the issue of lost electronic devices. Other clusters that are
          shown on the diagram include safety, rewards or claiming rewards, ease of access, and communication practices. The general solutions or fixes include
          ideas in which how the people can prevent the loss of an electronic item and even a way to find these items. The safety cluster pertains to how the
          people can safely retrieve items and prevent injury along with keeping the item from being stolen if lost. The cluster involving rewards and claiming
          rewards includes ways as to how the user can show their item's valubility and how much reward would be given to the person who finds these items.
          Lastly, the communication cluster includes ways how the people can get lost or stolen items back to their original owners along with providing a way
          for people to stay in contact with the owner who has lost their device.

        <p>
          In the first sketch, the user has lost their device and uses the app's "Tracking" option to find their device. They open the app and can view their location on the home screen.
          They click on the red "Track" tab in order to enable tracking on their device. This way, the user can see all devices and all of the device's locations. Since their device
          is far away, they will be promted with a path that shows the distance to their device and what their device is near. The user will be promted to end tracking once they are
          near their device.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          In the second sketch, the user wants to post about an item they had lost. The user opens the device and uses the "Bounty" feature where the user can view items
          that had been lost or post their own item that had been lost. In this case, the user creates a post that includes a description, an optional photo, and reward amount. Lastly,
          the user posts about their lost item onto the app.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the third sketch, the user wants to keep photo archive of all for their travels. The user opens the app and logins in with their information. Then the user is given
          the option to, and does, create a photo ablum. The user then uploads their photos to have them saved onto the app. 
        </p>

        <p>
          In the fourth sketch, the user wants post about an item they had lost. The user opens the device and uses the "Bounty" feature and creates a post that includes:
          a description, an image, an the most recent location or address of their lost item. After posting about their lost item, the user then has the option to edit their
          post or view the comment section. The comment section most likely would include comments about being more specific about the item, such as including a serial number
          or the time it was lost.
